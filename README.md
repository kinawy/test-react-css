# Welcome to Uphroia

This is a place to share short form content, much like an app that sounds like TipTop. Maybe you don't want to share all 
your data with China but you still want to understand what your friends are referencing. This is the app for you. Create 
a profile, following hashtags and other users, update your own profile with a bio, instagram link or a personal url.
